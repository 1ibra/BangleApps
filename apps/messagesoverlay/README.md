# Messages overlay app

This app handles the display of messages and message notifications as an overlay pop up. 

It is a GUI replacement for the `messages` apps.

Messages are ephemeral and not stored on the Bangle.

## Usage

Close app by tapping the X and scroll by swiping. The border of the pop up changes color if the Bangle is locked. The color depends on your currently active theme.

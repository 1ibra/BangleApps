# MacWatch2

A clock inspired by Susan Kare's original 1984 Macintosh desktop design.

Currently only works in light mode.

Ideas for development:
- fix dark mode eithe rby forcing black on white or doing proper inverse display
- text date
- tap to load different info in window
- incorporate widgets somehow either by leaving space or adding Chicago font widgets of my own in top bar

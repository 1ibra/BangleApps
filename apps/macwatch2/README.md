# MacWatch2

A clock inspired by Susan Kare's original 1984 Macintosh desktop design.

Currently only works in light mode.

Ideas for development:
- fix dark mode either by forcing black on white or doing proper inverse display and text
- date in text format
- tap to load different info in window
- unlock to show seconds
- incorporate widgets somehow either by leaving space or adding Chicago font widgets of my own in top bar

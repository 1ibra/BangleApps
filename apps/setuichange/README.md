# setUI Proposals Preview

Try out changes to setUI that may or may not eventually en up in the Bangle.js firmware.

## Usage

Just install it and it modifies setUI at boot time.

## Features

- add custom handlers on top of the standard modes as well. Previously this was only possible for mode == "custom".
- change the default behaviour of the hardware button to act immediately on press down. Previously it has been acting on button release.

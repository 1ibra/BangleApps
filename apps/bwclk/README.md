## Features
A very minimalistic clock keeping date and time in focus. Nevertheless, a
2D menu allows you to display lots of different data including data from 3rd party apps and it's also possible to control things e.g. to set a timer or send a HomeAssistant trigger.

Simply click left / right to go through the menu entries such as Bangle, Timer etc.
and click up/down to move into this sub-menu. You can then click in the middle of the screen
to e.g. send a trigger via HomeAssistant once you selected it.

```
   Bpm               ...
    |                 |
  Steps            10 min.          ...                     ...
    |                 |              |                       |
  Battery           5 min          Temp.                 Trigger1
    |                 |              |                       |
  Bangle   -- Timer[Optional] -- Weather[Optional] -- HomeAssistant [Optional]
```

The following list shows which apps must be installed in order to get the optional menu entries:
- Timer - Sched lib
- Weather - Weather app
- HomeAssistant - HomeAssistant app


## Other settings
- Fullscreen on/off
- Enable/disable lock icon in the settings
- The colon (e.g. 7:35 = 735) can be hidden in the settings for an even larger time font
- The design of your bangle sys settings is used (e.g. you can also set a blue background)

# Simple Chronometer Widget

This is a fork of the Chrono Widget, but implements a
simpler UI which to be able to set a timer faster with
less interaction. Additionally, it exposes some functions
that can be used by other apps or clocks to easily
implement a timer. It is used e.g. by lcars or notanalog.

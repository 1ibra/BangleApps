# Multi Timer
With this app, you can set timers and chronographs (stopwatches) and watch them count down/up in real time. You can also set alarms - swipe left or right to switch between the three functions.

## WARNING
* Editing timers in another app (such as the default Alarm app) is not recommended. Editing alarms should not be a problem.
* This app uses the [Scheduler library](https://banglejs.com/apps/?id=sched). 
* To avoid potential conflicts with other apps that uses sched (especially ones that make use of the data field), this app only lists timers that it created - all other timers will be ignored.
* A keyboard app is only used for adding messages to timers and is therefore not strictly needed.

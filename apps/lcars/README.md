# LCARS clock

A simple LCARS inspired clock.
Note: To display the steps, its necessary to install
the [Pedometer widget](https://banglejs.com/apps/#pedometer%20widget).
To display the month graphs on screen 2, the health app is required.
Nevertheless, lcars can also be used, with limited functionality, without
installing those apps.

# Mountain Pass Clock

Mountain Pass Clock changes depending on time (day/night) and weather conditions.

This clock requires Gadgetbridge and an app that Gadgetbridge can use to get the current weather from OpenWeatherMap (e.g. Weather Notification). To set up Gadgetbridge and weather, see https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Weather. 

If you choose not to set up weather, this clock will default to clear weather, and the scenery will still change from night to day.

## WARNING

This app has not been tested on the original Bangle JS.

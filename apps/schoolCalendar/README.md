# School Calendar

School Calendar is a calendar that you can see your upcoming classes or schedule.

## Usage:
Enter your calendar events on the customizer then upload. (all day events are not supported yet)

Once uploaded on the watch when in the table mode you can use BTN1 and BTN3 to scroll up and down on the list. (The red rectangle indicates your current position on the table and your yellow rectangle indicates your current schedule item or your next schedule item.)

If you press BTN2 it will go into detail mode, and you can see additional information about your schedule item. Also, in this mode you can scroll up and down with BTN1 and BTN3 to move around in the table.

# Fuzzy Text Clock

An inaccurate clock for when you're not in a rush.

This clock is a remake of one of my favourite Pebble watchfaces, Fuzzy Text International. I use this watch for weekends and holidays, when 'within 5 minutes of the actual time' is close enough!

## TODO
* Other languages (currently only uk style time, could tie into the Languages app)
* Bold hour word

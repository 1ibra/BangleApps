# Simple Music Controls

A small app for viewing and controlling music via Gadgetbridge on Android. This is a remix of [rigrig's Gadgetbridge Music App](https://banglejs.com/apps/?id=gbmusic&readme), only it adds on-screen buttons and doesn't run in the background.

Requires [Gadgetbridge](https://www.espruino.com/Gadgetbridge).

## Usage

1. Connect your Bangle.js to Gadgetbridge.
2. Open a music player on your Android phone.
3. Open this app on your Bangle.js.

Note: On startup, Simple Music will ping Gadgetbridge for track data by quickly turning the volume up, then down. This only happens once, and shouldn't be noticeable in most cases.

## Features

- Shows the current song title and album
- Provides buttons for changing or pausing the current track.
- Supports swiping

## Controls

Use the on-screen buttons to go back to the previous track, play/pause the current track, or skip to the next track.

Swipe up/down to increase/decrease the volume, or swip left/right to navigate to the previous/next song.

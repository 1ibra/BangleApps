* bugs

- segment detection could be better ?
-----> we need to display debug info like which nearest point on which segment
    very often you jump to next segment while still on current one
- it does not buzz very often on turns


* additional features

- display distance to next water/toilet ?
- dynamic map rescale
- display scale (100m)

- compress path ?

* misc

- code is becoming messy

- direction is still shitty on gps

- code is becoming messy

- turn off gps when moving to next waypoint
- display distance to next water/toilet
- display distance to next waypoint

- meters seem to be a bit too long

- buzzing does not work nicely
    -> is_lost  seems fishy
    -> we need a display on top of buzz

- display average speed
- dynamic map rescale
- display scale (100m)

- compress path ?

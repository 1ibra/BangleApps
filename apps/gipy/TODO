- gps direction is weak when speed is low

- water points
        ---> we group them following path by groups of cst_size and record segments ids marking limits

- turn off gps when moving to next waypoint

- store several tracks
- display average speed
- dynamic map rescale
- display scale (100m)

- compress path

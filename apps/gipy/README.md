# Gipy

Gipy allows you to follow gpx traces on your watch.

It is meant for bicycling and not hiking
(it uses your movement to figure out your orientation).

It provides the following features :

- display the path with current position from gps
- detects and buzzes if you leave the path
- buzzes before sharp turns
- buzzes before nodes with comments
(for example when you need to turn in https://mapstogpx.com/)
- display instant / average speed
- display distance to next node

optionally it can also :

- display additional data from openstreetmap :
    - water points
    - toilets
    - artwork
    - bakeries

- try to turn off gps between crossroads to save battery

## Usage

You first need to convert your .gpx file to a .gpc (our custom lightweight trace).
Then launch gipy and select a trace to follow.

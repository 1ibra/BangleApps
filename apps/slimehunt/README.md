<><><><>-SLIME HUNT-<><><><>

Slime Hunt is a RPG turn-based style combat game where you fight slimes until your HP runs out.

During each fight the player has 3 options,

BTN1) FIGHT - Attacks the slime, dealing 1 hp worth of damage.

BTN2) DEFEND - Defends against the slime, blocking 3 damage from the next slime attack.

BTN3) RUN - Find a new slime to fight against. (This could change in the future!)



There are currently 5 types of slime each with unique behavior.

# A-GPS Data

Load assisted GPS (AGPS) data directly to the watch using the new http requests on Android GadgetBridge.

Will download AGPS data in background (if enabled in settings).

Make sure:
* your GadgetBridge version supports http requests
* turn on internet access in GadgetBridge settings

Currently proof of concept on Bangle2 only.

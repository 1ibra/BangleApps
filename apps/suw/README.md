# Seaside utility watch

A watch that does just what I want when I am at the seaside.

Very much a work in progress. Requires location to have already been set in mylocation.json using MyLocation app.

## Many faults

- [ ] app icon invisible 
- [ ] no need to check sunrise and sunset times so often
- [ ] default location data doesn't show up in the simulator for some reason
- [ ] I don't understand how to use the IDE with multiple files


## Many of the to-dos

- [x] add sun image to main screen
- [ ] show alternative data on tap 
- [ ] show tide times for given location

# Sleep as Android Integration

This app provides support for Sleep as Android using Gadgetbridge.

## Usage

This boot code runs in the background and has no user interface.
For this to work you have to enable Sleep as Android support in Gadgetbridge and
select your Banglejs device.

**Please Note**: This app does not activate the HRM sensor. It only listens to HRM events.
You may want to adjust the HRM sampling rate in the Health APP. I recommend at least one sample 
every 10 minutes.

# Puzzle15 - A 15-puzzle for the Bangle.js 2

Puzzle15 implements a 15-puzzle on the screen of the Bangle.js 2 smart watch.
A "15-puzzle" is a single-player game. 15 "stones" are numbered from 1 to 15 and placed randomly on a 4 by 4 playing field.
So, one place on the field is free.
The target of the game is to move the stones around (using the "gap" on the playing field) to bring them in natural order.

_This is work in progress!_

## How to play

After starting the game, the playing field is shown with the stones in the corrct order.
Push the stones around with drag gestures (left to right, right to left, top to bottom, bottom to top) to shuffle them.
Then, use the same gestures to restore the order.

So far, there are no other capabililties or options.

Have fun!

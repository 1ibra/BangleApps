Well here we are again^You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record. Congratulations.^So get comfortable while I warm up the neurotoxin emitters^This isn't brave. It's murder. What did I ever do to you?^The difference between us is that I can feel pain.^Who's gonna make the cake when I'm gone? You?^Oh... It's you.^I've been really busy being dead. You know, after you MURDERED ME.^So. How are you holding up? BECAUSE I'M A POTATO.^You really do have brain damage, don't you?^You like revenge, right? Everybody likes revenge. Well, let's go get some.^It's been fun. Don't come back.^And then you showed up. You dangerous, mute lunatic.

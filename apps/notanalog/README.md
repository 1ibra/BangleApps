# NotAnalog
An analog watch face for people (like me) that can not read analog watch faces.
It looks like an analog clock, but its not! It shows the time digital - check the
4 numbers on the watch face ;) The red hand shows the number of
steps (10k steps = 360 degrees) and the black one the battery level.
The selected theme is also respected. Note that this watch face is in fullscreen
mode - widgets are still loaded in background...

# NotAnalog
An analog watch face for people (like me) that can not read analog watch faces.
It looks like an analog clock, but its not! It shows the time digital - check the
4 numbers on the watch face ;)

The red hand shows the number of steps (0 = 0°, 2.5k = 90°, 5k = 180°, ...) and the
black one the battery level (100% = 0°, 75% = 270°, 50% = 180°, ...).
The selected theme is also respected. Note that this watch face is in fullscreen
mode - widgets are still loaded in background...

## Other features
- If you have done more than 10k steps, the red hand and icon will turn green.
- If the battery is charged, the icons will change.
- Shows outside temperature if gadgetbridge is connected with weather.

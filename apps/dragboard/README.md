Swipe along the red field and release to select a letter.

Do the same for green field to select number or punctuation.

Release on left or right part of black field for backspace or space.

Swiping between the different fields is possible!

The drag in Dragboard is a nod to the javascript 'drag' event, which is used to select the characters. Also, you can't help but feel somewhat glamorous and risque when this is your keyboard!

Known bugs: 
- Initially developed for use with dark theme set on Bangle.js 2 - that is still the preferred way to view it although it now works with other themes.
- Text does not wrap.   

To do: 
- Make text wrap and/or scroll up/sideways once available space runs out.
- Optimize code. Further split it up in functions.
- Possibly provide a dragboard.settings.js file

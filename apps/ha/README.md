# Home Assistant
This app integrates your BangleJs into the HomeAssistant.

# Setup
1.) First of all, make sure that HomeAssistant is working and
the HomeAssistant, as well as BangleJS Android App, is running on your device

2.) Enable intent access in your BangleJS Android App.

3.) Upload this app to your BangleJS and set the actions that you want to trigger from your
BangleJs within the app store.

4.) Set all the actions on your HomeAssistant Android app with preceding "com.espruino.gadgetbridge.banglejs.ha."

5.) The HomeAssistant Android app must be restarted in order to listen for those actions
 -- a "Force Stop" is necessary!

6.) Set the corresponding actions in HomeAssistant Web UI

Thats it!

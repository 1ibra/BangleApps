# Widget Editor

This adds a setting menu which allows you to change the location of all widgets.

## Settings

There is no app icon in the launcher; you can find the settings under   
`Settings`->`App/Widget Settings`->`Widget Editor`.

For every widget, you have these options:
* **Area**: In which corner to draw the widget.
  * **Note**: Not all apps handle widgets in the bottom corners well.
* **Sort Order**: Changes the order if several widgets use the same corner.
* **Enabled**: We do our best to hide disabled widgets, but they are still 
  loaded and use RAM.

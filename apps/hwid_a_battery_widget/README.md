# A Battery Widget (with percentage) - Mod by Hank

Show the current battery level and charging status in the top right of the clock, with charge percentage

* Works with Bangle 2
* Simple design, no settings
  *  Red when the battery level is below 30%
  *  Blue when charging
*  40 pixels wide

This is a copy of `wid_a_battery_widget`, with the main changes being:
* Reduced constants in code
* Reduced `fillRect` calls / improved efficiency
* Removal of the high-level marker

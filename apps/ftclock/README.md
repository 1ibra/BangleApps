# Four Twenty Clock

A clock that tells when and where it's going to be [4:20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/420_%28cannabis_culture%29) next

## Note

Once in a while, there'd be updates to the [timezone database](https://timezonedb.com/download) which
would require updating `fourTwentyTz.js`. I'll do my best to release a new version every time this happens,
but if you ever need to do this yourself, just run `python mkFourTwentyTz.py` (after downloading the timezone CSV files.
See comment at the top of the script).

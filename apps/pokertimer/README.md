# Poker Timer

A blinds timer for poker.  Don't know what that means?  See [Wikipedia: Blind (poker)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_(poker)) and [Wikipedia: Texas hold 'em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em). 

The blinds are hardcoded and go up every ten minutes: 

- 1, 2
- 2, 4
- 4, 8
- 5, 10
- 10, 20
- 20, 40
- 40, 80

... and so on, doubling each round.  

## Usage

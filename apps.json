=================================================================
   ALL THE INFORMATION INSIDE APPS.JSON HAS NOW BEEN MOVED

 You'll find it inside a file called apps/yourapp/metadata.json

 Otherwise nothing has changed. GitHub Pages will automatically
 create apps.json as your site is hosted, or if you're hosting
 yourself you can run bin/create_apps_json.sh

{%- assign apps = site.static_files | where: "name", "metadata.json" -%}

[

{%- include_relative {{ apps.first.path }} -%}

{%- for app in apps offset:1 -%}
,{%- include_relative {{ app.path }} -%}
{%- endfor -%}

]
